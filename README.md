# Do not run this exe

I got this exe from a relative who fell for a scam.
He reached out asking how to run this exe.

This exe seems like a bait, it does nothing, will ask for couple of input and fail intentionally.
maybe to get the victim to pay for the "full version" or like a interactive scam.

So far have not found any exfltration code. still searching for it.

used : https://github.com/zrax/pycdc for decompiling the exe
